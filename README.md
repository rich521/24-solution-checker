# 24-solution-checker

A 24 Math game solution checker. 

I created and used this looped algorithm to develop my math mobile game app for android.

The looped algorithm will return an 'if possible' solution of 24 with 4 numbers between from 1 to 12.

### Instuctions

2. Run index.html
3. Input 4 numbers from 1 to 12 in the 4 boxes
3. Hit 'Enter'
4. Returns a solution if possible
